# Plant-Disease-Classification
This repository contains a deep learning-based solution for detecting and classifying diseases in tomato plants' leaves. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras, the model is trained on a dataset of labeled leaf images, enabling it to identify various diseases and the healthy condition of tomato plants.
