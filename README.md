# Plant Leaf Disease Detection

## Overview

This project provides a deep learning-based solution for detecting and classifying diseases in tomato plants' leaves. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras, the model is trained on a dataset of labeled leaf images, allowing it to identify various diseases and the healthy condition of tomato plants.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies tomato plant leaves into specific disease categories, including:
  - Bacterial Spot Disease
  - Early Blight Disease
  - Late Blight Disease
  - Leaf Mold Disease
  - Septoria Leaf Spot Disease
  - Target Spot Disease
  - Yellow Leaf Curl Virus Disease
  - Tomato Mosaic Virus Disease
  - Two-Spotted Spider Mite Disease
  - Healthy and Fresh

- **Web Application**: A Flask-based web interface allows users to upload images of tomato leaves and receive instant predictions regarding the health of their plants.

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
